# COSC 4P02


Brock University and Niagara-on-the-Lake Museum require software that allows visitors
to learn and explore history showcased by the museum in the form of an interactive
timeline system. The application will provide visuals of historic significance and upon
interaction from the user, it will provide further information on the topic. The software
will make use of the museumâ€™s database in-order to provide historical background.

The interactive timeline system will help visitors retrieve historical information in a
convenient and interactive manner.
Museums commonly use interactive tools to:
- Engage the audience.
- Provide a sensory element to the information being given.
- Users will leave the museum with a more in depth knowledge and a memorable experience.
